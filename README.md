# Snake Game
A classic Snake game implementation in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface.

## Overview
This Snake game is a modern implementation of the classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game board.

## Features
- Smooth snake movement with keyboard controls
- Dynamic score tracking
- Randomly generated food placement
- Game over dialog with score display
- One-click restart functionality
- Clean, minimalist UI with grid lines


## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:
   - ↑ (Up Arrow): Move up
   - ↓ (Down Arrow): Move down
   - ← (Left Arrow): Move left
   - → (Right Arrow): Move right

2. Guide the snake to eat the red food blocks to grow longer and increase your score.

3. Avoid collisions with:
   
   - The boundaries of the game board
   - The snake's own body

4. When the game ends, a Game Over dialog will appear showing your final score.

5. Press the SPACE key to restart the game.


## Technical Implementation

The game is built using:

- Java Swing for the GUI components
- Custom rendering for the snake, food, and game board
- Event-driven architecture for handling user input
- Timer-based game loop for consistent gameplay


## Requirements
- Java  17 or higher
- Minimum screen resolution: 800x600

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-java.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd snake-java
```

3. Compile the Java files:
```
javac *.java
```
4. Run the game:
```
java App`
```
## Future Improvements

- Add different types of food with special effects (speed boost, score multiplier)
- Implement obstacles or walls in advanced levels
- Create a progressive difficulty system where the snake speeds up as the score increases
- Add power-ups that provide temporary abilities (passing through walls, immunity to self-collision)


### Technical Improvements

- Implement a high score system with persistent storage
- Add sound effects and background music
- Create a settings menu to customize game parameters (speed, board size, colors)
- Optimize collision detection for better performance
- Add support for touch controls for mobile/tablet deployment


### UI Enhancements

- Create a more polished main menu with game options
- Implement different visual themes or skins for the snake and game board
- Add animations for eating food and game over scenarios
- Improve the game over dialog with additional statistics (time played, average speed)
- Add a pause menu with resume/restart options
